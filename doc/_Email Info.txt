Hi Collin,

I will provide you with the Fortran source code for TRANS4D (version 0.2.6), together with some descriptive information, in five installments with this being the first installment.

This installment includes the current version of the “TRANS4D User Guide”. This first installment also includes two technical publications discussing some of the crustal motion issues addressed by TRANS4D.

The second installment will include the bulk of the Fortran source code for TRANS4D (version 0.2.6).

The third installment will include velocity data for seven regions in Fortran’s “unformatted” format.
      
The fourth installment will include velocity data for the Caribbean region in Fortran’s “unformatted” format.

The fifth installment will include several data sets that may be used to familiarize yourself with the use of TRANS4D.

Cheers,
Richard Snay

Hi Collin,

This second installment includes the five files embodying the Fortran source for TRANS4D (version 0.2.6).

The bulk of the source code is contained in “trans4d.f”.

The other four files constitute information in Fortran’s “block data” format:
•         initbd.f – specifies the geographic boundary for each regional model
•         initeq.f – specifies the parameters for 29 earthquakes
•         initps.f – specifies the parameters for postseismic motion
•         initvl.f – specifies the parameters for the velocity grids .

These five files need to be compiled together to create the executable code for TRANS4D. 
 
Cheers,
Richard Snay

Hi Collin,

This third installment contains velocity data for seven (of the eight) gridded regions in Fortran’s “unformatted” format. The TRANS4D’s executable code will read this file as needed.

Hi Collin,

This fifth installment contains several data sets that may be used to familiarize yourself with the use of TRANS4D. 

Note that the “TRANS4D Users Guide”, that was provided in the first installment, contains a set of seven exercises to familiarize people with the use of TRANS4D. In particular, these exercises involve the use of the data sets contained in this installment.

Cheers,
Richard Snay
